		<h1>Hipsters</h1>
		<p class='author'>By Harsh Patel</p>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Hipster is a term popularly used to denote a contemporary <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture”'>subculture</a> in North America, Australia and Europe primarily consisting of Millennials living in urban areas.[1] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[2] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), progressive or independent political views, organic or artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[3][4][5] Hipsters are typically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>
		<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
		<p>Hipster culture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]". Christian Lorentzen of Time Out New York argues that "hipsterism fetishizes the authentic" elements of all of the "fringe movements of the postwar era—beat, hippie, punk, even grunge", and draws on the "cultural stores of every unmelted ethnicity", reinventing it "with a winking inauthenticity."</p>
